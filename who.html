          <h3>Who I am</h3>
          <p>I'm Chelsey, a UX Developer who has a passion for creating a valuable user experience. I know JavaScipt and jQuery. I know CSS and SASS. I know Git and GitHub. But most importantly, <span> I know people.</span> I know what makes them tick. I know how to ask the questions that get the answers to the things that really make a difference. </p>
          <h3>How I got here</h3>
          <p>I started noticing that regular people couldn't do what they wanted to do on the web, and I thought, "that's gotta stop!" I enrolled in the Front End Development Cohort at The Iron Yard where I learned the basics of Front End Development.</p>
          <h3>Where I'm going</h3>
          <p>Using my expertise as a Cultural and Lingusitic Analyst: I create comfortable, accessible user experiences. I get inside people's heads to find value that can be leveraged to make the web work for them.</p>
